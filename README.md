# CS446_Project
Project:Chinese Handwritting Characters recognition through TDNN models with Transfer learning and Image Processing 
Code: 
1. Codes for data processing are saved in Folder named ‘Data_Processing_Matlab’. Put database HCL2000 and run main1 in Matlab to gernerate 30X500 training data X_Train and Y_Train, 30X200 Test Data X_Test and Y_Test for Handwritting Characters. Run main2 to generate the 30X15 Training data for printed characters (The generated data are saved in Floder named ‘Data’) 
2. Codes for TDNN model are saved in Folder named ‘TDNN_Python’ Put data and Run in python to get the accracy and figures. (TDNN_1 is for printed characters and generate weight, TDNN_2 is for training and testing Handwrittings)
